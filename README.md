Escape From Psychotic School RPG

This is a fully functional text-based RPG. I built it to teach myself OOP concepts and try my hand at learning class design, design patterns etc. Much of the original code was adapted from a pretty good book called Make Your Own Python Text Adventure by Phillip Johnson, but I've modified it pretty heavily.

Some features I added:
- world/level map
- 5 different starting maps, randomly selected at the beginning of each playthrough 
- high scores saved to external file using pickle
- beginnings of a level-up/XP system
- NPC trader
- looting dead enemies
- enemies are randomly aggro'ed when entering a room
